# Mark III Ironman Helmet
First of all, here is the [link to the project](http://thedraill.e-monsite.com/pages/projects/mark-3-ironman-helmet.html).

The libraries needed to run the code are provided with the code itself. So thanks to [ArminJo](https://github.com/ArminJo/ServoEasing) for the ServoEasing library, and thanks to [johnwasser](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/combine-two-voice-recognition-module/910286/10) for modifying the VoiceRecognitionV3 library (from [Elechouse Team](https://github.com/elechouse/VoiceRecognitionV3)) to make it works with Serial1.

## **Version 1**
Version 1 has a TTP223B sensor that can detect the approach of a hand through plastic, as well as 2 servo motors to open/close the helmet and 2 LEDs for the eyes.

## **Version 2**
Version 2 adds a voice recognition module that allows the helmet to react to a few voice commands.
